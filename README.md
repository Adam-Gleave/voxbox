# voxbox
Voxel engine, written in C++, using OpenGL.
Current status: Renders a voxel cube terrain.
Depends upon GLEW, GLFW, GLM, and FastNoise. Current QEF implementation taken from Nick Gildea's work at https://github.com/nickgildea/DualContouringSample
This work is heavily inspired by his, and it is worth taking a look at.
